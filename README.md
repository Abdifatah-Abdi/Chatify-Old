# Chatify
Chatify! A tool to communicate with family, friends, and communities online. Paired with great features like End-To-End encryption, customizability, a privacy focused platform, and more.

That aside, we aren't expecting people to use Chatify over any other application like [Discord](discord.com) and [WhatsApp](whatsapp.com). We made this project test our skills. From what is seems, we're doing pretty well.

You may also see us using professional language on Chatify. This is intended. Although it isn't ideal to use Chatify, we still want to make a site that looks like it is.

## Authors of Chatify

## What makes Chatify unique?
Chatify is unique because unlike other platforms, we don't collect and sell user data (albiet, we don't know how to do that), we offer tons of customizability for our platform, including modifications, and a dedicated API (coming soon). Not to mention, Chatify is open source.

## What is Chatify built on?
Chatify, unlike other chatting application, uses plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Messages, Users, and Groups are stored in a DataBase (for the time being, [Airtable](airtable.com)), and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), used to send, and update messages real-time.
