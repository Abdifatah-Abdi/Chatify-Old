# Chatify
Chatify! A tool to communicate with family, friends, and communities online. Paired with great features like End-To-End encryption, customizability, a privacy-focused platform, and more.

That aside, we aren't expecting people to use Chatify over any other application like [Discord](https://discord.com) and [WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com). We made this project test our skills. From what it seems, we're doing pretty well.

You may also see us using professional language on Chatify. This is intended. Although it isn't ideal to use Chatify, we still want to make a site that looks like it is.

## EOL of Chatify
### Well I guess you can't call it EOL but...
The site, Chatify, at first seemed like a great way to build skills for us with web development. However, not all things come free, like servers.\
The #1 thing that prevented us from finishing this project was servers. Every single server provider we tried to find was, either paid or free... but you've gotta give them your billing info. This, obviously wasn't ideal, especially for high schoolers like us. Now, we could scour the internet for a free server provider (and trust us, we did), but they never were the right fit. 

## Authors of Chatify
Meet our team! ...of 3 people. [Abdifatah-Abdi](https://github.com/Abdifatah-Abdi), [Omar](https://github.com/Elyossef-Omar), and [Advay-c](https://github.com/advay-c).

I, Abdifatah-Abdi, was in charge of the backend of Chatify. This includes monitoring and using the DataBase, sockets, and the backend.

ClounZ was in charge of the little things, and although I made the basic functionality of the site, ClounZ extended it further.

Advay-c was in charge of code optimization and bug fixes along with prioritizing Git & GitHub utilization.

## What makes Chatify unique?
Chatify is unique because, unlike other platforms, we don't collect and sell user data (albeit, we don't know how to do that), we offer tons of customizability for our platform, including modifications, and a dedicated API (coming soon). Not to mention, Chatify is open source.

## What is Chatify built on?
Chatify, unlike other chatting applications, uses plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Messages, Users, and Groups are stored in a database (for the time being, [Airtable](https://airtable.com)), and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), used to send, and update messages in real-time.
