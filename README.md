# Chatify
[Chatify](https://chatify.tunnelapp.dev)! A tool to communicate with family, friends, and communities online. Paired with great features like End-To-End encryption, customizability, a privacy-focused platform, and more.

That aside, we aren't expecting people to use Chatify over any other application like [Discord](https://discord.com) and [WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com). We made this project test our skills. From what it seems, we're doing pretty well.

## EOL of Chatify
The site, Chatify, at first seemed like a great way to build skills for us with web development. However, not all things come free, like servers.\

## Authors of Chatify
Meet our team! ...of 3 people. [Abdifatah-Abdi](https://github.com/Abdifatah-Abdi), [Omar](https://github.com/Elyossef-Omar), and [Advay-c](https://github.com/advay-c).

[Abdifatah-Abdi](https://github.com/Abdifatah-Abdi), is in charge of the backend of Chatify. This includes monitoring & using the DataBase, sockets, & the backend.

[Omar](https://github.com/Elyossef-Omar) is in charge of the little things, contributing to a mix of both frontend UI fixes & improvements, & added some backend functionality.

[Advay-c](https://github.com/advay-c) is in charge of code optimization, bringing ui desings to life, bug fixes along with prioritizing Git, GitHub & tunnel utilization.

## What makes Chatify unique?
Chatify is unique because, unlike other platforms, we don't collect and sell user data (albeit, we don't know how to do that), we offer tons of customizability for our platform, including modifications, and a dedicated API (coming soon). Not to mention, Chatify is open source.

## What is Chatify built on?
Chatify, unlike other chatting applications, uses plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Messages, Users, and Groups are stored in a database (for the time being, [Airtable](https://airtable.com)), and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), used to send, and update messages in real-time.
